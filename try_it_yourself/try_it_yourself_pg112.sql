--7.1
-- Both tables get a primary key using surrogate key id values that are
-- auto-generated via serial data types.
-- The songs table references albums via a foreign key constraint.
-- In both tables, the title and artist columns cannot be empty, which
-- is specified via a NOT NULL constraint. We assume that every album and
-- song should at minimum have that information.
-- In albums, the album_release_date column has a CHECK constraint
-- because it would be likely impossible for us to own an LP made before 1925.

--7.2
-- We could consider the album_catalog_code. We would have to answer yes to
-- these questions:
-- Is it going to be unique across all albums released by all companies?
-- Will we always have one?

--7.3
-- Primary key columns get indexes by default, but we should add an index
-- to the album_id foreign key column in the songs table because we'll use
-- it in table joins. It's likely that we'll query these tables to search
-- by titles and artists, so those columns in both tables should get indexes
-- too. The album_release_date in albums also is a candidate if we expect
-- to perform many queries that include date ranges.
